#SpeedRunsLive Electron Race App

Currently only displays current races and indicates their number of entrants and current state

This is just a toy app I made to test my ReactJS abilities, using fetch to pull from an API, and creating an Electron app.
I don't expect people to actually make use of this currently

style.less is downloaded straight from speedrunslive.com with minor edits to center the list properly.
